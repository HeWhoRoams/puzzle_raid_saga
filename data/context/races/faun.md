The Faun is one of the 10 races available for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the trophy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Faun or any other race not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the trophy will have a 50% chance of leveling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Faun also unlocks the class: Priest

Racial bonus: Rejuvenate (HP is restored to 25% on level up if it is currently lower than 25%)

Mortal enemy: Assassin (Damages your health for twice it's attack power each turn if he's in the bottom row. Since it will still attack normally, that means triple the usual damage!)

Mortal enemy effect: Automatically moves down 1 tile each turn
