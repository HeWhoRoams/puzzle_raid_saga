The Elf is one of the 10 races avaliable for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the throphy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Elf or any other race not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the throphy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Elf also unlocks the class: Ranger
