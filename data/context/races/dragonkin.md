The Dragonkin is one of the 10 races avaliable for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the throphy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Dragonkin or any other race not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the throphy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Dragonkin also unlocks the class: Paladin

Racial bonus: Fire breath (ignite a random enemy every time you use a skill. Ignited enemies are dealt damage at the end of the turn)

Mortal enemy: Freezing (Freezes two random tiles each turn. Frozen tiles cannot be matched, and frozen enemies cannot attack. Tiles unfreeze when the turn ends)

Mortal enemy effect: Your base damage is halved while Freezing is alive
