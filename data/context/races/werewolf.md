The Werewolf is one of the 10 races avaliable for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the throphy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Werewolf or any other race not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the throphy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Werewolf also unlocks the class: Assassin

Racial bonus: Cripple (enemies with less HP than armor die at the end of the turn)

Mortal enemy: Vampire (Heals itself by its attack value every time it hits you)

Mortal enemy effect: Can gain health above its maximum health
