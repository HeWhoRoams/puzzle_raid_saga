The Dwarf is one of the 10 races avaliable for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the throphy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Dwarf or any other race not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the throphy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Dwarf also unlocks the class: Warrior

Racial bonus: Uppercut (extra weapon damage to enemies swiped upwards, which means tracing a path from the tile directly under to the tile directly above the enemy)

Mortal enemy: Chaotic (Jumps to a random position every turn, consuming the tile it lands on)

Mortal enemy effect: Can only be damaged by uppercuts
