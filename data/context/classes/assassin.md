The Assassin is one of the 10 classes available for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop trophies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the trophy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Assassin or any other class not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the trophy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.
