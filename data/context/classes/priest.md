The Priest is one of the 10 classes avaliable for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the throphy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Priest or any other class not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the throphy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Priest also unlocks the race: Faun

Class perk: Faithful (double effect from regeneration upgrades)

Class flaw: Cautious (-20% armor piercing)

Class skill: Wish (Single use skill. Collect all tiles)
