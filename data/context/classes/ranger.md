The Ranger is one of the 10 classes avaliable for play. It can be unlocked by killing special enemies, which sometimes will drop throphies. If playing with the Adventurer class, the throphy will have a 100% chance of unlocking any class & race, which may be the Ranger or any other class not already unlocked. If playing with another class than the Adventurer, the throphy will have a 50% chance of levelling that class up, and a 50% chance of unlocking a new class & race.

Unlocking the Ranger also unlocks the race: Elf

Class perk: Agile (5% of swords spawn as arrows instead. Arrows can match enemies 1 tile away)

Class flaw: Slim (-1 armour)

Class skill: Volley (Convert all swords into arrows. Arrows can match enemies 1 tile away)
